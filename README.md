                            BFS-VS-DFS

The app gives a visual representation of the differences between
a breadth first search(bfs) and depth first search(dfs) graph algorithms.
Its generates the same starting and target nodes for the two algorithms.
The app then try to compute with visualization the time it takes for
each of the algorithms to arrive at the target node(number) from the
starting node(number).
